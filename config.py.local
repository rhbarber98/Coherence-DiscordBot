# API token configuration file for local deployments

# This file is for configuring your Discord API token when deployed to a local environment.
# You should enter your token below, replacing "Your Discord API Token" with the token from your Discord developers dashboard.
# Only modify the token, as modification of the variable name itself will result in an error at runtime.

API_KEY = 'Your Discord API Token'
